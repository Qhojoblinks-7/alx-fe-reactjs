# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Now that you have a strong grasp of the foundation, we can explore:

Intermediate Features:

Organizing state using slices for larger apps.
Middleware for logging or debugging state changes.
Persisting state to localStorage.
Advanced Applications:

Building a dynamic app (like a To-Do List or Shopping Cart).
Managing multiple interdependent states.
Performance Optimization:

Using selectors to avoid unnecessary re-renders.



Using Zustand Devtools Middleware
Debug and inspect state changes with browser devtools.
Persisting State with Middleware
Save state to localStorage or sessionStorage so it persists across page reloads.
Subscribe Middleware for Advanced Observability
React to specific state changes or listen for changes in state selectors.
Custom Middleware with Complex Logic
Build middleware for features like API syncing or analytics.
